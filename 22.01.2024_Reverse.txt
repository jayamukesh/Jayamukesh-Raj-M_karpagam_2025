a Reverse Integer

Sample Input

123

Sample Output

321

Explanation

Reverse digits of an integer.

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


n=input()
n1=n[::-1]
print(n1)
